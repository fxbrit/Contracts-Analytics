# Contracts-Analytics
Extension for SESC that allows you to get an overview of your smart contracts by creating a .json file, containing your most popular type of smart contract based on its list of functions, and then it shows you the 10 most popular templates available in your collection, with the number of contracts that are similar or identical to it.
Functions from the erc20 standard are pruned as they don't necessary describe the functionality of the smart contract.

## HOW TO USE
Copy the file functions_and_variables.csv you created using SESC inside the main folder, then just run this tool.
